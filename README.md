### Hi there 👋 It's Duy!

I'm a data science enthusiast. I graduated from University of Dallas in May 2022, B.S. in Computer Science, cum laude.

Something else about me:
- 😁 I speak English, Vietnamese (chào các bạn Việt Nam!), Parseltongue 🐍 (well just... Python, I'm not Harry Potter), SQL, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and a few more...
- 📫 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/caominhduy) or feel free to send me an email @ [this email address](mailto:caominhduy@gmail.com)
- 💡 I am working on [epicas](https://github.com/caominhduy/epicas), an AutoML framework for epidemiology forecasting
- 📷 I also love photography --- check out my photos @ [500px](https://500px.com/p/nerdgreatdustin)
