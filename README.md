### Hi there 👋 It's Duy!

Here is some *quick* introduction about myself (professionally and personally 🍻):
- I am a Data Scientist at Home Credit Vietnam. I'm working on various areas, but I'm mainly focusing on credit risk modeling and providing antifraud solutions.
- I graduated Computer Science (B.S.) from the University of Dallas.
- 😁 I prefer communication in English and Vietnamese only, though I sometimes would like to introduce myself as a proud member of Duolingo's French Streak Society (*salut!*).
- 📷 I am a photography and coffee geek --- check out my photos @ [500px](https://500px.com/p/nerdgreatdustin).
- 💡 I am working on various stuffs, but feel free to reach out for any collaboration!
