### Hi there 👋 It's Duy!

I am pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Dallas and graduating in May 2022.

- 😁 I speak English, Vietnamese (chào các bạn Việt Nammmm!), Parseltongue 🐍 (well just... Python, I'm not Harry Potter), SQL, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and a lot more...
- 📫 Connect to me @ my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/caominhduy) | [Email](mailto:caominhduy@gmail.com)
- 💡 We can chat about 🤖 machine learning, 📈 data science, ⛏️ data engineering, etc. I may even share with you about a [supposedly cool] project that I have been working on!
- 📷 I also love photography, check out my photos @ [500px](https://500px.com/p/nerdgreatdustin)
- ☕ or coffee! I am a fan of Light Roast Washed Ethiopian coffee, but I also drink natural process, too.
